    <h1>about</h1>
    <p>Hi, I'm Mason! Welcome to my portfolio website.</p>

    <p>Currently, I’m in my second year of undergrad @ UIC studying Computer Science & Design, expecting to graduate in Spring 2028. Over the past year, outside of things thrown at me in classes, I’ve been focusing on user interface design & implementation as, although I’ve made user interfaces that function since my Sophomore year of high school (4 years ago, wow!), they aren’t well designed in my opinion. I’ve been studying what makes a user interface easy to navigate and communicative. What makes it good? Hopefully this website is a good example.</p>

    <p>Thank you for reading and visiting, always feel free to shoot me an email!</p>
