    <h1>about</h1>
    <p>Hi! I'm Mason! Welcome to my cool portfolio website!</p>

    <p>Currently, I’m in my second year of undergrad @ UIC studying Computer Science & Design, expecting to graduate in Spring 2028. Over the past year, outside of things thrown at me in classes, I’ve been focusing on user interface design & implementation as, although I’ve made user interfaces that function since my Sophomore year of high school (4 years ago, wow!), they aren’t well designed in my opinion. I’ve been trying to figure out what makes a user interface easy to navigate and communicative? What makes it good? Hopefully, by the time I graduate, I will have figured that out.</p>

    <p>Other than that, I’ve been exploring recently the realm of 3D design. I’ve gotten as far in Blender as ALMOST being able to follow the donut tutorial by Andrew Price where I actually understand what he’s talking about. HEAVY on ALMOST.</p>

    <p>Thank you for reading and visiting, always feel free to shoot me an email!</p>
