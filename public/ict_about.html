    <h1>about</h1>
    <p>Hi, I'm Mason! Welcome to my portfolio website.</p>

    <p>Currently, I’m in my second year of undergrad @ UIC studying Computer Science & Design, expecting to graduate in Spring 2028. Over the past year, outside of things thrown at me in classes, I’ve been focusing on user interface design & implementation as, although I’ve made user interfaces that function since my Sophomore year of high school (4 years ago, wow!), they aren’t well designed in my opinion. I’ve been studying what makes a user interface easy to navigate and communicative. What makes it good? Hopefully this website is a good example.</p>

    <p>Other than that, I’ve been exploring recently the realm of 3D design. I've been lucky to be able to utilize UIC's FabLab to 3D scan objects and manipulate them in Blender or use them as part of projects in three.js.</p>

    <p>Thank you for reading and visiting, always feel free to shoot me an email!</p>
